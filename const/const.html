<h4>JavaScript const</h4>
<h4>JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared:</h2>
<h4>When to use JavaScript const?
    Always declare a variable with const when you know that the value should not be changed.
    
    Use const when you declare:
    
    A new Array
    A new Object
    A new Function</h4>
<h4>Constant Objects and Arrays
    The keyword const is a little misleading.
    
    It does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.
    
    Because of this you can NOT:
    
    Reassign a constant value
    Reassign a constant array
    Reassign a constant object
    But you CAN:
    
    Change the elements of constant array
    Change the properties of constant object</h2>
<p>Declaring a constant array does NOT make the elements unchangeable:</p>
<p>The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)

    Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared
    
    Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned
    
    Variables defined with const have Block Scope</p>
<p id="demo"></p>
<script>
// Create an Array:
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

// Change an element:
cars[0] = "Toyota";

// Add an element:
cars.push("Audi");

// Display the Array:
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = cars;
